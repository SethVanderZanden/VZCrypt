# VZCrypt

## Welcome to the VZCrypt Package
The goal is to make it easier on streamers to be able to open any file and not have to worry about users seeing the naked keys. It also makes it easier to not connect to a 3rd party or PAY for one.

If using to store online, I recommend creating one JSON file or some other file to be ignored by git.

### Usage

#### Generate Key
To generate a key it is a string extension method .GenerateKey()

#### Encrypt
To encrypt simply call .EncryptString(putKeyHere)

#### Decrypt
To encrypt simply call .DecryptString(putKeyHere)

#### Thats all it is.
